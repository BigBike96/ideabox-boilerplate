Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." In this project, we'll be building an application that records and archives our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we'll rely on JavaScript to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and `localStorage` to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

## Learning Goals

* Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
* Understand how to implement client-side data persistence using `localStorage`
* Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
* Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP
